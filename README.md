# worldOutline

The JavaScript port of the World Outline software.

## Archive notes, 2022

### 5/14/22 by DW -- the content folder

I was looking for the source of a website, and it led me to the World Outline software, which I ported from Frontier to Node in 2017 or so.  

I went looking for the source outlines, and found them -- and wanted to archive them somewhere where people might see them if they were looking for world outline examples. So this was the place.

However, the site was private. I guess I didn't want people to be confused that this was going to be supported in some way going forward. I did the work basically to save me from having to convert a bunch of sites to PagePark, it seemed easier to just run them in a port of the World Outline software. 

Anyway, I'm not going to get the software running at this time, but I did want to get the outlines out there, so that's what you have here. 

### 5/14/22 by DW -- version numbers

Somewhere in the last five years I changed the version number format from v0.51a to v0.5.2. 

I'm going to start using those numbers here going forward. 

### 5/14/22 by DW -- source.opml

Another convention established since this was last published, including a file named source.opml with all the source for the project in a single outline, as I edit it on my desktop.
