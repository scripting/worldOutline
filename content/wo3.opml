					<outline text="About this list">
						<outline text="No spoilers here. But little winks at people who have watched the show. "/>
						<outline text="Not complete. Still writing and of course watching. &lt;a href=&quot;http://davewiner.com/&quot;&gt;Dave&lt;/a&gt;"/>
						</outline>
					<outline text="Shows I loved and highly recommend">
						<outline text="The Wire">
							<outline text="The show that got bingeing started as far as I'm concerned."/>
							<outline text="Baltimore cops, dealers, people, longshoremen, news people."/>
							<outline text="I've heard people say it's hard to get started with, but it's worth it."/>
							<outline text="I've watched it at least five times, probalby six or seven (lost count)."/>
							</outline>
						<outline text="Breaking Bad">
							<outline text="Walter White and Jesse Pinkman in the meth age, in Albuquerque. One of the best binges. "/>
							</outline>
						<outline text="The Sopranos">
							<outline text="New Jersey Mob boss in therapy."/>
							<outline text="The best show, right up there with The Wire, and the one that got the whole bingeing things started."/>
							<outline text="Lots of people didn't like the finale, but I &lt;i&gt;loved&lt;/i&gt; it. "/>
							</outline>
						<outline text="Game of Thrones">
							<outline text="Medieval depravity and dragons. "/>
							<outline text="Never can wait for the next season."/>
							<outline text="Next one starts in April 2016."/>
							</outline>
						<outline text="Battlestar Galactica">
							<outline text="Low budget cheesy special effect science fiction with a great cast, writing, story. "/>
							<outline text="It's worth staying for the punchline, which some &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuoVwA7AsFI&quot;&gt;people&lt;/a&gt; didn't like but I did."/>
							<outline text="Great use of music, lots of innovative ideas about the future, the security of nets."/>
							</outline>
						<outline text="Better Call Saul">
							<outline text="Even better than Breaking Bad. "/>
							<outline text="There's one episode in the first season where you get the full back-story on Mike, and it's just the best single episode of TV ever. The rest of the season pales, but it's also great entertainment. "/>
							<outline text="But -- you should watch Breaking Bad before BCS, imho."/>
							</outline>
						<outline text="Six Feet Under">
							<outline text="Family-run mortuary in LA."/>
							<outline text="Always good to watch, the show finale is the best finale ever."/>
							</outline>
						<outline text="Mad Men">
							<outline text="Advertising in the 60s. Smoking and drinking and sexing. "/>
							<outline text="Great acting, characters. "/>
							<outline text="Best scene: the finale of course, but before that Bert Cooper's &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKgPTkIulEI&quot;&gt;song&lt;/a&gt; and dance. "/>
							</outline>
						<outline text="Deadwood">
							<outline text="One of the best ever, but they stopped making the show before the climax. "/>
							<outline text="I hear they're making a movie, but it's been ten years, and I think it can't possibly work."/>
							<outline text="The story of the real town of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadwood,_South_Dakota#19th_century&quot;&gt;Deadwood&lt;/a&gt; is amazing. "/>
							<outline text="But, even with the disappointment of no good ending, it's still a great show. "/>
							</outline>
						<outline text="The West Wing">
							<outline text="Not quite a binge show, it's not really a serial, but it's great watching."/>
							<outline text="It's like Hill Street Blues at the White House. "/>
							</outline>
						<outline text="Fargo">
							<outline text="You wouldn't think it could be good because the movie was so amazing, but it is good the way the movie was, but at the same time original. Two fantastic seasons so far. Another in the pipe, fo4 2017."/>
							</outline>
						<outline text="Making a Murderer">
							<outline text="Netflix series about Steven Avery of Wisconsin who was framed for rape, and then tried for murder, and is currently in jail. "/>
							</outline>
						<outline text="Mr Robot">
							<outline text="A delusional Snowden, on hard drugs."/>
							<outline text="Loved it. Will definitely watch season 2."/>
							</outline>
						<outline text="The Americans">
							<outline text="Soviet spies in Washington, passing as Americans at the height of the Cold War."/>
							</outline>
						<outline text="Homeland, early seasons">
							<outline text="Loved this show, but it turned bad. "/>
							<outline text="I made it through season 5, waiting for something interesting to happen, but it was boring, awful, waste of good actors. No story. I won't watch it next season."/>
							<outline text="The first few seasons are quite good. "/>
							</outline>
						<outline text="Transparent">
							<outline text="I have to admit the idea of Jeffrey Tambor as a trans woman made me ill, but I watched the show anyway, and it was great, both the first and second seasons. They take a while to get started, and the characters are mostly horrible people, but the stories are touching and finally they do win you over. Only in Season 2 you get to hate them all over again. And then it all makes sense, etc. "/>
							<outline text="BTW, Angelica Houston has a small but nice role. I learned a new acronym from her character: NATO == Not Attached To Outcome. "/>
							</outline>
						<outline text="The Fall">
							<outline text="Gillian Anderson from the X-Files as a super macho Irish police chief working a on serial murder. "/>
							</outline>
						<outline text="Olive Kitteridge">
							<outline text="It's a very fine three-part short binge, with Frances McDormand as Olive, and a suprirse role by Bill Murray. Very sweet story, but not linear, which I like of course. "/>
							</outline>
						<outline text="The Knick">
							<outline text="A hospital in early 1900s New York. Very gory. I had to avert my eyes for the worst of it. But the story is compelling and it is beautifully done. "/>
							</outline>
						<outline text="Boss">
							<outline text="The mayor of Chicago suffers from a fatal disease but that doesn't stop the depravity."/>
							<outline text="Kelsey Grammer is great. You like evil? This is for you!"/>
							</outline>
						<outline text="Silicon Valley">
							<outline text="I thought I wouldn't like this because it's real close to home, even more than Halt and Catch Fire which I did not like (see below). But they nail it. All the crazy narcissism and cynical back-stabbing and money lust that makes up the tech industry, and it's funny in a Beavis and Butthead way. "/>
							</outline>
						<outline text="Rome">
							<outline text="An HBO series that no one ever seems to talk about, but it was good."/>
							<outline text="Takes place in ancient historic Rome, the time of Caesar and Cicero and all the slaves and nobles and how they live and die (more about dying than living)."/>
							</outline>
						<outline text="Narcos">
							<outline text="Netflix drama about the life and death of Pablo Escobar in Columbia. A very worthwhile binge. "/>
							<outline text="Update: Season 2 is great too. "/>
							</outline>
						<outline text="The Leftovers">
							<outline text="What happens when two percent of the population disappears. Seemingly at random. "/>
							<outline text="Two seasons, both good. No one knows what happened. A good story. Drifts a bit here and there, has a bit of the feel of Lost, but better, imho."/>
							</outline>
						</outline>
					<outline text="Shows I watched that I feel meh about">
						<outline text="The OA">
							<outline text="I watched it all the way to the end, it was great until about the halfway point, then it drifted slowly to a confusing unsatisfying end. "/>
							</outline>
						<outline text="Stranger Things">
							<outline text="See the description for The OA, above? Exactly the same. "/>
							</outline>
						</outline>
					<outline text="Shows I tried to watch and didn't like or don't recommend">
						<outline text="Treme">
							<outline text="Another one every says is great, but I never made it past John Goodman who seemed very fat and unhealthy and that's basically all I remember about it. I was expecting The Wire. Probably should try again. But maybe once is enough. "/>
							</outline>
						<outline text="Halt and Catch Fire">
							<outline text="Everyone says this is a great show but I can't get into it. "/>
							<outline text="I tried watching season 1, and it was both ridiculous and inaccurate."/>
							<outline text="People said try season 2, and I lost interest for the same reason."/>
							<outline text="My theory is that I actually lived that period of history in the computer industry. I know what happened. They are wrong about it. I imagine this is how lawyers must feel about Law &amp; Order for example. I can't fit the real story and their bullshit story in the same brain. It just doesn't fit. "/>
							<outline text="You may like it, but don't believe that's how it happened because it didn't happen that way."/>
							</outline>
						<outline text="Lillyhammer">
							<outline text="A mob boss in hiding in Scandanavia. It's fun for a while, but I lost interest in the second season."/>
							</outline>
						<outline text="Weeds">
							<outline text="I liked it for a couple of seasons, but just lost interest. "/>
							</outline>
						<outline text="Man in the High Castle">
							<outline text="Drags on and on, over-acted. I hate shows that have huge dramatic moments that don't feel dramatic. So you play the heavy music and make your face move like it's heavy, but nothing fucking happened."/>
							<outline text="Maybe it's because I read the book. Which was okay. I basically like everything with Nazis in it, and this could have been fantastic if they had any showmanship, but ugh."/>
							</outline>
						<outline text="Lost">
							<outline text="I kind of liked Lost while it was happening, but I would love to have gotten the time back."/>
							<outline text="I would watch just the first episode, and leave it at that. The show never topped that. That was the hook that kept me watching, thinking it might get back up to that level again. It never did."/>
							</outline>
						<outline text="House of Cards">
							<outline text="I hate this show. It's so awful. And it could have been so good. "/>
							<outline text="None of the things the characters do make sense. "/>
							<outline text="I saw the British version, and that one was GREAT. "/>
							</outline>
						<outline text="Boardwalk Empire">
							<outline text="I watched the first couple of seasons, but fell behind and never caught up."/>
							<outline text="I guess you could say it wasn't holding my interest."/>
							</outline>
						<outline text="Big Love">
							<outline text="Current-day polygamy in Mormon SLC. "/>
							<outline text="This could have been on either list."/>
							<outline text="I didn't watch the last season, but otherwise liked the show."/>
							<outline text="But it lost me somewhere. "/>
							</outline>
						</outline>
					<outline text="Shows I have queued up">
						<outline text="Master of None"/>
						<outline text="Jessica Jones"/>
						<outline text="Justified">
							<outline text="People say to skip Season 1, which I tried, but got bored with. I plan to start with Season 2. Everyone says it's great. "/>

					<outline text="Scripting News is a blog">
						<outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/&quot;&gt;This&lt;/a&gt; is a blog, it's not a hosting service.  "/>
						<outline text="On this blog, I write about my experiences and post observations about the things I'm interested in. "/>
						</outline>
					<outline text="Role of comments">
						<outline text="The role of comments on this site are to add information and perspectives that might be interesting to the author of the blog, primarily, and secondarily to people who read the blog. "/>
						<outline text="They should always take into account what is said in the post. If you haven't read the post in full, reasonably carefully, don't comment. If it is obvious that you have not read the post, your comment will be deleted."/>
						</outline>
					<outline text="Not a free speech zone">
						<outline text="It's not a free speech zone. It's not a place for you to be heard. "/>
						</outline>
					<outline text="Moderation">
						<outline text="Comments are moderated. Any comment that does not follow these guidelines will be deleted. If you post more comments that violate the guidelines, or complain about your comment being deleted, you'll be blocked from posting  comments. "/>
						</outline>
					<outline text="No spam!">
						<outline text="It's not a place for you to promote your products, services, blog, initiatives, political causes. Don't post spam. "/>
						</outline>
					<outline text="Don't argue">
						<outline text="I'm not interested in debates here on my blog. "/>
						<outline text="If you want a debate, host it somewhere else, and if I'm interested in participating I will."/>
						<outline text="If not, I won't. (I probably won't, I don't enjoy debates.)"/>
						</outline>
					<outline text="No blog posts">
						<outline text="Keep your comments short. If you find you need to post more than a few sentences that's a clue that you are really writing an blog post, which is great, not a comment. Go get a blog if you don't already have one and post your ideas there, along with a link to this post so people know what it's in reference to. You may send me a link via email if you want me to read it."/>
						</outline>
					<outline text="Not personal">
						<outline text="Absolutely no personal comments about me or anyone else. "/>
						<outline text="Yes, I can handle disagreement. I do want to hear other points of view. Briefly stated without getting personal."/>
						<outline text="Your comment wasn't moderated because you disagreed, it was moderated because you didn't follow the rules."/>
						</outline>
					<outline text="How to find this doc">
						<outline text="There's a link to this page in &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2016/01/21/guidelines.png&quot;&gt;the Stuff menu&lt;/a&gt; on every new story page on Scripting News. "/>
						<outline text="Here's an &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/liveblog/users/davewiner/2016/01/20/0902.html&quot;&gt;example&lt;/a&gt; of a story page."/>
						</outline>
					<outline text="Summary">
						<outline text="These guidelines have worked well to keep comments simple and useful to everyone. The idea is to share missing information. To answer questions posed in the post. It is not a place for speeches, there are plenty of places for that on the web. We've been doing this for a long time and have heard all the arguments, and are not interested in hearing them again.

						<outline text="In 2012, I &lt;a href=&quot;http://rssjs.org/&quot;&gt;expressed&lt;/a&gt; an interest in this and quite a discussion followed, it's a really interesting snapshot. The format I described didn't, as far as I know, gain traction, and I stopped updating the JSON version of Scripting News in 2014, and let the domain lapse. "/>
						<outline text="I believe in Postel's Robustness Principle. We've learned over and over that one format is better than two, no matter how much better the second is. The second format adds complexity, and we can't ever expect to retire an open format. It would defy the intent of &quot;open&quot; to even try. After all who are we? The format belongs to the world, not any person. It's the fundamental difference between open structures and silos. "/>
						<outline text="But there may be advantages to using JSON. We might as well find out. But there's no need to rip up the pavement. We'll use all the well-understood concepts of RSS, and change the format we use to transmit them. That's why simply the name of this project is RSS-in-JSON."/>
