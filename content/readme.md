# Content

I had these outlines in my database, they all contain World Outline content.

I exported them as OPML, and put them in this folder. 

May they stay safe here for perpetuity.

You can open these files in an OPML-compatible outliner such as <a href="http://drummer.scripting.com/">Drummer</a>. 

Some of the headlines don't have visible wedges because they are of a node type Drummer doesn't know about. 

I think the most frequent culprit is "blogpost" which I could solve by adding it to the table of known types, which I will try to remember to do. :smile:
